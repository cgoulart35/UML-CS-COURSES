# Computing-For-Health-and-Medicine

How to run:

1. Please open the file in Google Collaboratory.
2. Run just the first step alone. You will need to type in "y" to confirm pip commands. This will uninstall the ospq pre-installed on the remote machine, installed the scikit-survival dependencies and also reinstall the correct version needed for ospq. Next, it will install the correct version of tensorflow (1.13.1).
3. Click on "runtime" at the top, and then click "restart and run all". You will need to type in "y" again to confirm pip commands.
4. Let the program run; it will take a little while since the computation is GPU heavy.
5. Once finished, you may not see the TensorBoard output graphs (the last step). If so, please run the very last step again to display the output.
