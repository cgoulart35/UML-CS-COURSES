How to install:
  - First, place the db2 folder containing our project code into the C:\xampp\htdocs
    folder.
  - Next, run the Apache and MySQL XAMPP modules and open the MySQL admin page.
  - Next, import the DB2.sql file into your db2 database. I recommend dropping
    the database first (db2 -> operations -> remove database), then creating it again
    (new -> "db2" as name -> utf8mb4_general_ci -> create). Import the sql file by
    clicking on db2 -> import -> choose the db2.sql file -> utf-8 -> go.
  - Lastly, navigate to http://localhost/db2/index.php or http://localhost/db2/ and
    you are ready to go!



Listed below are locations in our code of the project requirements and how to perform
these actions as a user using the web interface:

  1. Admin will have a default account. Parents and students will be able to create an
     account. Parents must create account before their children. Students are put into groups
     according to their grade level. Students will be able to update their own accounts;
     parents will be able to update both their own and their children’s accounts.

     CODE LOCATION:
        registerStudent.php, registerParent.php, registerAdmin.php, student.php (update info
        lines 65-147), parent.php (update info and child's info lines 50-193), and in
        admin.php (update info 68-139 and other users' info 189-270)
     INSTRUCTIONS:
        To register as a specific user, click on register the type of user you want to
        register on the homepage and fill in the form with the desired information. Remember,
        to register a student a parent account must already exist and be given at student
        registration.
        To edit a user's information they registered with, you will need to login. A student
        can edit their own information, a parent can edit their own and their children's
        information, and an admin can edit their own or anyone's information.
        To login as a user, click login or sign in and enter the correct email and pasword.
        Logging in will take you to the student.php, parent.php, or admin.php depending on
        who you logged in as.
        To edit your own information, type new inputs into the form at the top of the page
        after you log in and click submit. If you want to edit your child's information or
        another user's information as an admin, click Edit Student or Edit Parent or Edit
        Admin next to the corresponding user's name and type new inputs into the form at the
        top of the page and click submit.
       

  2. There are 7 groups, from Group6 to Group12. A 9-grade student may be mentor of
     Group6 and mentee of Group9. A 10-grade student may be mentor of both Group6 and
     Group7, and so on.

     CODE LOCATION:
        student.php (lines 149-420), dropAsMentor.php, dropAsMentee.php, dropMeetingsAsMentor.php,
        dropMeetingsAsMentee.php, dropAllAsMentor.php, dropAllAsMentee.php, addAsMentor.php,
        addAsMentee.php, addMeetingsAsMentor.php, addMeetingsAsMentee.php, addAllAsMentor.php,
        addAllAsMentee.php, db2.sql (group requirements lines 325-331)
     INSTRUCTIONS:
        As either a student, parent, or admin, go to a student's page (your own page if you
        are a student) and view the various tables called "Meetings --- is a mentor of:",
        "Possible meetings for --- to be a mentor of:", "Meetings --- is a mentee of:",
        and "Possible meetings for --- to be a mentee of:". Mentor tables will only show up
        for students in grade 9-12 as grades 6-8 can only be mentees. Mentee tables will only
        show up for students in grade 6-9 as grades 10-12 can only be mentors. As you can see,
        only grade 9 students can see both mentor and mentee tables. Meetings in specific groups
        that the student can be a mentor or mentee of will show up based on the group/grade the 
        student is in. The student can add or drop one displayed meeting, add or drop all displayed
        meetings with the same name (for the rest of the year), or add or drop all meetings that
        are available in the tables in general. You can also click on view meeting to see the
        meeting's information, the meeting's material if you are a mentee or mentor, or a parent of,
        or an admin, the meeting's mentees and mentors if you are logged in as a mentor or admin, 
        and an option to post materials if you are logged in as an admin.

  3. Meeting are hold on Saturday and Sunday evenings. All meetings are one-hour long.
     Each meeting should have 3-6 mentees and 2-3 mentors. A student can join all the
     future meetings for the academic year or join only one meeting for the week by end of
     Thursday of the week; Mentees and mentors can quit from a meeting or all meetings at
     any time. Mentees and mentors can also be assigned to meetings by admin.

     CODE LOCATION:
        student.php (lines 149-420), dropAsMentor.php, dropAsMentee.php, dropMeetingsAsMentor.php,
        dropMeetingsAsMentee.php, dropAllAsMentor.php, dropAllAsMentee.php, addAsMentor.php,
        addAsMentee.php, addMeetingsAsMentor.php, addMeetingsAsMentee.php, addAllAsMentor.php,
        addAllAsMentee.php, parent.php (assign meetings by editing children lines 123-193), and in
        admin.php (assign meetings by editing students 189-270), db2.sql (meeting information on
        lines 337-351)
     INSTRUCTIONS:
        Again, a student can add or drop one displayed meeting, add or drop all displayed
        meetings with the same name (for the rest of the year), or add or drop all meetings that
        are available in the tables in general. Notice the warnings displayed on the possible
        meetings tables; if there are already 3 mentors or 6 mentees, your add request will not
        go through. Previous meetings will not show up as possible meetings, but they do show up in
        enrolled meetings. Future meetings show up, however you can only add the current week's
        meetings by Thursday. Mentors and mentees can also be assigned by admins and parents (children)
        by clicking on the Edit Student button for the desired student, and then adding the meeting(s).

  4. A mentor will be able to see list of other mentors and all mentees of the meetings he/she
     is mentoring including names and email addresses.

     CODE LOCATION:
        student.php (view meeting buttons within lines 149-420), meeting.php (view mentors and mentees
        if mentor, parent of mentor, or admin lines 221-268)
     INSTRUCTIONS:
        Again, you can also click on view meeting to see the
        meeting's information, the meeting's material if you are a mentee or mentor, or a parent of,
        or an admin, and the meeting's mentees and mentors if you are logged in as a mentor or admin, 
        and an option to post materials if you are logged in as an admin.

  5. A meeting with fewer than 3 mentees will be canceled on Friday. All participants of the
     meeting need to be notified of the cancelation. If a meeting has fewer than 2 mentors, 
     the admin will need to add mentors to the meeting. For simplicity, you can just generate
     notification files which contain the names and email addresses of the users who should
     be notified.

     CODE LOCATION: TBD
     INSTRUCTIONS: TBD

  6. The admin will post study materials to each group’s meetings every Friday for the
     following week. A student will be able to see the current and past materials for each
     meeting of the group he/she is in.

     CODE LOCATION: admin.php (post buttons lines 141-187), meeting.php (post materials lines 105-179 &
        view materials lines 181-219), student.php (view meeting buttons within lines 149-420)
     INSTRUCTIONS:
        Logged in as an admin, click on post materials for a certain meeting. You can also view meetings
        off a student page when logged in as an admin and post materials that way. Admins can post materials
        to all current and future meetings whenever he/she wants to. Students of meetings
        will be able to see posted materials by clicking view meeting.

Notes:
  - We decided to use CSS to make out interface a little easier to interpret the content
    shown on different pages.
  - Throughout the PDF, there was no requirement to add meetings, so we did not implement this.
